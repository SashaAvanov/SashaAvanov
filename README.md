- 👋 Hi! I’m Sasha, a full-stack developer based in Sacramento. 
- 👀 I’m interested in building full-stack websites and daily-use applications.
- 🌱 I’m currently building with JS, Node, React, Express, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on any fun projects related to music, nerdy stuff like Pokémon, or useful everyday apps that streamline things like organizing events. Currently updating a potluck organizing app and building a coffee review app! 
- 📫 You can reach me at sasha.devanov@gmail.com
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him
- ⚡ Fun fact: I've been a musician for over 17 years and I speak Russian!
